		  such as a failure to consider longer-term trade-offs
		  properly. The MP approach does, however, also have

		  required for its development and an argued inflexibility
		  after implementation. Solutions that have been developed to

		  common advantage of the use of an MP approach in these five
		  fisheries has been to render the process of providing

		  Queensland East Coast Trawl fishery was undertaken in 2010
		  to develop a management plan for the next 10 years. A key
		  question raised at the start of the review process was:
		  what should the management plan achieve? As with fisheries
		  management in most countries, multiple management
		  objectives were implicit in policy statements, but were
		  poorly specified in some areas (particularly social
		  objectives) and strongly identified in others (e.g., an
		  objective of sustainability). As a start to the management
		  review process, an analysis of what objectives the
		  management system should aim to achieve was undertaken. A
		  review of natural resource management objectives employed
		  internationally was used to develop a candidate list, and
		  the objectives most relevant to the fishery were
		  short-listed by a scientific advisory group. Additional
		  objectives specific to Queensland fisheries management, but
		  not identified in the international review, were also
		  identified and incorporated into the objective set. The
		  relative importance of the different objectives to
		  different stakeholder groups was assessed using the
		  Analytic Hierarchy Process. As with other studies, the
		  relative importance of the different objectives varied both
		  within and between the different stakeholder groups,
		  although general trends in preferences were observed.",
